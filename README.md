### kata execution

I used tags to represent the end of a series of changes related to a specific part of the project:
- backend.v.1: I am generally able to learn a new programming language without spending too much time in its documentation;
even obscure functional ones such as haskell; and I found kotlin special; it has way too many keywords. I will need
to read its documentation carefully. Learning Rust was easier in comparison.
- frontend.v.1: No tests has been made; I am one of those who think only end-to-end tests should be made to test the frontend;
especially because end-to-end test frameworks provides better developer experience (cypress, playwright).
- backend.v.2 : I was toying with java type system.
